# Prolixus Prototype
`prolixus : wide, broad, long / willing, obliging, favorable. (mostly chosen 
since it sounds cool)`
## Goal of this version
To generate a prototype of the game to be remade in C++ for proper scalability.
## Fundamental Game Mechanic
The idea is that it's a dungeon explorer with a single world that is 
procedurally generated and explored by all players. Other aspects are still 
to be decided on. 
## Model
The model-view-controller will be implemented for this
